# IoT Device Tracker

This projects is a basic application to track IoT devices.

It is structured in two parts / folders:

# Backend

### `npm start`

Runs the backend server.

The backend is created with node.js express framework and uses json-server to create a server that exposes a REST api structure based on the data contained on the file db.json

Since the data is structured under a "devices" node, it exposes the server api under /devices on port 5000

# Frontend

A proxy property has been added pointing to the backend server so that the requests to fetch data from the backend server can be made relative:

`"proxy": "http://localhost:5000",`

The frontend side was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the frontend project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm dev`

For development purposes, it runs the frontend server with nodemon, to pickup changes on the fly. It requires nodemon to be already installed

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
